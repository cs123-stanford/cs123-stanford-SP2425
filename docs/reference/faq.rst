1. Pupper's Raspberry Pi is not turning on / has some power issue

Some of the older bottom PCBs have broken 5V regulators. Other boards have working 5V regulators that stop working when the Raspberry Pi also gets power over USB. In either case, we recommend unplugging the 5V power to the RPi (the black and red 2-wire cable) and instead powering the Pi via USB C from a computer or portable battery.
